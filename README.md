# Build your AI Chatbot with Zero Coding

In this workshop, we are going to create a  customer service Assistant for a bank. We are looking to automate some of the top questions that are reaching our agents via support chat on our site,in this scenario - people trying to transfer money to friends or family.

We will Start by redirecting people contextually into the bank's application if they have a transfer to make under $1000

## Step 4: Create your First action

4.1 - click on  create a new action


<img width="611" alt="8" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16270682/141001953-15ebda6a-ed8f-4f9d-8819-667cd1ed9d24.PNG">

<img width="439" alt="8-1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16270682/141002029-eaeb7f69-002d-49e4-9ea8-02d657a91836.PNG">


#### We are going to setup 3 steps for our action


4.3 - change the title of the action in the top left to something more consumable - "Transfer funds"

4.6 - Step 1: In our first step, enter **"How much would you like to transfer?"** and Under options, we can define the type of response we anticipate from the user. select **currency** and click on next step

<img width="687" alt="8-2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16270682/141002064-80f377c8-ff34-4d31-b6fb-d78342d82a0e.PNG">


4.7 - Step 2: In our second step, enter **"When do you want to make this transfer?"** select **date** 

***Note that the system can detect dates in plain language, not just formatted (e.g. tomorrow, two weeks from now, etc...)***

<img width="690" alt="10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16270682/141002082-8c9cb0fc-7ac4-402b-8dbc-5284bfce3a04.PNG">



4.7 - Step 3 (a): In our third step, add a simple confirmation message to make sure we've got everything right. add "Just confirming, you want to transfer $ "$step1" on "$step2?"

Notice how we can use the $ sign to call upon pieces of information the user has already provided in an earlier step - these are called variables

<img width="718" alt="11" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16270682/141002097-be91b270-179d-45ea-91b2-6e2e5d55be56.PNG">

In this step, you can also define options for our customers from directly within the step itself - unlike most tools which require you to set up a separate "entity"
Let's add yes and no under **options**, We can even add some synonyms for Yes and No yeah, ya, nah, nope. Also change the skip step setting to "always ask".

4.8 - Step 3(b): let's define what happens if the user selects Yes or No. In this step, user selects YES. 

To set this up, we will add a condition, which must be met for this step to be triggered

add **"Great, let's finish the transfer directly in our app where we will gather your account information and the transfer destination. Click here to continue."**Â 

Highlight "click here to continue" and make it a link. In the link, type the following:
"dtebank.com/transfer?date=(step1)&amount=(step2)" You can, in fact, add variables to your URL, if your transactional engine requires it
We must then indicate to the system that this step ends the action successfully

4.9 - Step 3(c): let's define what happens if the user selects No. 

Add **"Whoops! Let's start over."**

In this case, instead of ending the action, we'd want to re-prompt previous steps so the user can start over. Select all of them so that the user goes back to the beginning of the action. Select every step (1-4) to re-prompt

## Step 5: digressions

5.1 - Truly complex situations, such as when customers change the topic of a conversation entirely mid-flow, are called digressions.
